# Dialog Redo

This mod provides a feature-rich dialog interface. All methods and classes are documented as [Lua Language Server annotations](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/), refer to the comments in the source code for how to use this library.

This mod came from [Wuzzy's Glitch game](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/glitch/) but is completely redesigned and is not compatible with it.
